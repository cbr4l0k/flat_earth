# Flat Earth

I've been using [fizzy](https://github.com/basecamp/fizzy) for a while, and
I love it, for real, it's great. But for really small things, like the way
data is managed and being coded in `ruby`, I feel no motivation at all to
keep doing these small fixes to fit my personal workflow. AI is here, and
with it, the ability to make products that fit perfectly to myself is now
possible; therefore, flat earth is something really stupid, that I'm just
doing because I don't want to adapt to reality, I want reality to adapt to
me (like a real flat-Earther). I wanna try `convex`, and use `typescript`
like a real normie, also... A real way to use a telegram bot that helps me
with my mess. Yeaaaah #FlatEarth will be great, maybe I'll add crypto at
some point because **why not?**

> Also, **flat** is an antonym for **fizzy**.

## Research 

Claudia ~yes, I call Claude: Claudia~, made [this](./docs/fizzy-analysis)
deep research into the original product.

## I have no clue about front end!

I do really want to learn about Convex, so most of the database related code is
going to be mine. But I have a deep allergy to CSS and HTML; doctors say
it's lethal... So for safety reasons Claudia will do that for me 🎨.
