# Flat Earth

I've been using [fizzy](https://github.com/basecamp/fizzy) for a while, and
I love it, for real, it's great. But for really small things, like the way
data is managed and being coded in `ruby`, I feel no motivation at all to
keep doing these small fixes to fit my personal workflow. AI is here, and
with it, the ability to make products that fit perfectly to myself is now
possible; therefore, flat earth is something really stupid, that I'm just
doing because I don't want to adapt to reality, I want reality to adapt to
me (like a real flat-Earther). I wanna try `convex`, and use `typescript`
like a real normie, also... A real way to use a telegram bot that helps me
with my mess. Yeaaaah #FlatEarth will be great, maybe I'll add crypto at
some point because **why not?**

> Also, **flat** is an antonym for **fizzy**.

## Research 

Claudia ~yes, I call Claude: Claudia~, made [this](./docs/fizzy-analysis)
deep research into the original product.


## I have no clue about front end!

I do really want to learn about Convex, so most of the database related
code is going to be mine. But I have a deep allergy to CSS and HTML;
doctors say it's lethal... So for safety reasons Claudia will do that for
me 🎨.

### I had some token left...

So I checked my Claudia usage, and I had some tokens left an hour before
usage reset; therefore, I did what any respected adult under [agent
psychosis](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2026/1/18/agent-psychosis/) would do:
change to `Opus 4.5`, activate `plan mode` and:

```
Hey Claudia, I want to be able to do the transition from `fizzy` using the
notes on @docs/fizzy-analysis/, but the convex part I want to do myself
from now on. Make a course guide that teaches me progressively both
TypeScript and convex. I have no experience in either, although I am more
of a computer science person/engineer. I want to have a good application,
and I don't want to work on the frontend from now on. It should be multiple
documents, and describe a learning plan that helps me learn how to develop
under this stack. Use tan-stack for the other stuff (I don't understand
what it is, but I've heard everyone is using it).
```
